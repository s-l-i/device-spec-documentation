Anecdotal Installation Record

 > 8/21: Lutron Caseta app has been replaced with Lutron App
 > 1. In, app: homeowner or professional (jbest: configured as homeowner for initial setup) 
 > 2. On initial connection to the internet, the bridge will download firmware updates.  This can take 15 minues. Light on device displays in a circular pattern.
 > 3. Configuration on app was automatic (did not need to select "HUB" or other device to pair)


 #### Expected Return Data Type and Sample
